# Abraxas - Sovereign Guardians for RWAs
# Abraxas — RWA Stock Market on Solana

**The first on-chain Real World Asset Stock Market. Tokenized athlete equity, real estate, music rights, trading portfolios, and IP licensing — built on Solana, managed by AI agents, protected by an on-chain circuit breaker.**

---

## What Is Abraxas?

Abraxas is a decentralized RWA Stock Market where real-world assets are tokenized, vaulted, and grown by AI agents using verifiable performance data. It is available as a web app (Vercel) and a native Android app.

The first live asset class is **Athlete Equity** — fractional ownership tokens tied to the real training, game stats, and NIL economics of individual athletes. Every token price is driven by on-chain data, not speculation.

---

## Early Adoption: Two Onboarding Paths

### 1. Token Acquisition — Direct equity stake
Abraxas tokens are **live**. Buying now means owning fractional equity in the RWA market infrastructure at its earliest valuation. Token holders gain position before Real Estate, Music Rights, Trading Portfolios, and IP Licensing expand the underlying demand surface.

### 2. La Casa NFT Onboarding — Capital bridge → token airdrop
La Casa NFTs are the stablecoin-backed capital onboarding mechanism for Abraxas vaults. Each NFT embeds a USDC deposit that routes into a specific RWA vault on-chain. Early NFT holders are recorded as capital founders and receive a **proportional Abraxas token airdrop** at launch.

Both paths converge at the token — two roads to the same destination: early equity in the Abraxas RWA Stock Market.

## Platform Architecture

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| **Vaults** | On-chain PDA accounts holding RWA positions — stablecoin exposure, athlete mints, value growth, protective buffer |
| **King AI (Orion)** | Performance engine — reads athlete metrics, emits `build / accelerate / protect` signals, executes growth on-chain |
| **Sophia Agents** | Per-vault AI agents (Sentinel / Yield / Defensive) — assignable on-chain with auditable rules hash |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Three-signal risk system — price speed, liquidity drain, activity spike → `None / ReleaseLiquidity / PauseRisk` |
| **La Casa NFTs** | Capital onboarding layer — NFT purchase → stablecoin vault deposit → athlete token appreciation |
| **OYM Integration** | Live athlete data sync from Own Your Moment, feeding real training & game stats into token state |
| **Market Page** | Professional data book — live listings, filter by class, score, thesis, hypothetical pipeline |
| **Mobile (Android)** | Capacitor APK — package `io.abraxas.app`, version 1.1 |
